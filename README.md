### :wrench: Requirements
* Nextcloud instance running
* Nextcloud Android app installed (≥ 3.9.0)
* Nextcloud Quicknotes app enabled. Note that the development versions require the development version of Quicknotes, and the released versions the latest Quicknotes from appstore.

### :warning: Limitations:
* It only works with the nextcloud client installed (and I don't expect to create a custom login.)
* It works 100% online, without any type of cache.
* You can view the shared notes, but you cannot yet share or reject shared notes.
* **Needless to say, it was barely tested..**. 😅  hahaha.
